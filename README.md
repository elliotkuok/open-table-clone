# Key Features
**Feature 1:** Restaurant pages

Each restaurant page provides users with comprehensive details about the establishment. This includes a description, address, operating hours, cuisine type, and more. Users can get a feel for what the dining experience would be like even before making a reservation. Additionally, directly integrated into the restaurant page is the reservation system. Users can quickly see available time slots and table options, allowing them to seamlessly book a reservation without navigating away from the page.
